"""Pediatric profile.

Children's-health encounters (ages 0-18): primary-care and specialty visits plus some
inpatient / ED, with pediatric diagnoses and procedures. Mortality is very low (as in real
pediatrics); continuity of care with an assigned pediatrician is the headline quality metric.
Generic synthetic data — facility and place names are illustrative, not tied to any real
health system.
